## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm interested in understanding how web applications and automation work — from architecture to implementation details.  
I actively explore new tools and technologies, work with databases and user interfaces, and dive deeper into process logic.

## 🎨 Beyond Work

In my free time, I enjoy being creative — I draw.  
My interest in visual art helps me pay closer attention to interfaces and user experience.

✨ *Always open to new knowledge, ideas, and exciting projects.*
