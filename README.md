## 💫 Hi, I'm @Darlykn

I'm interested in how web applications and automation work from architecture to implementation details.
I am actively exploring new tools and technologies, working with databases and user interfaces and delving into the logic of processes.

In my free time I like to be creative and draw.
My interest in art helps me pay more attention to interfaces and user experience.

✨ *Always open to new knowledge, ideas, and exciting projects.*
